# Tiny Apple II+

This repository is instructions to make a mini Apple II+ that __really works__

To do:
- Upload Integer BASIC and Applesoft to a microcontroller
- 3d print a mini Apple II+ to contain it
- Upload Apple programs to SD card
- 3d print a mini floppy drive for SD card
- Attach mini drive to mini Apple (with wire)
- 3d print a mini monitor
- Attach Adafuit monitor to 3d printed one
- Attach monitor to Apple (with wire)
- Use Bluetooth to attach Mac/any keyboard

#### Just notes and ideas. Because getting into this project might involve understanding what it takes to upload ancient software onto modern machines. The microcontroller has more than 64k of RAM but it doesn't mean it needs to run like it does. My goal would be to copy the look and feel of the activity. Turn on the machine, load a floppy disk, RUN the program. That kind of thing.
